# MAGIC NODE PLUGIN (C#) -- UNREAL ENGINE 5

I've put together a system which I call "Magic Node CS" where we can write some C# functions in-place on any Blueprint Graph and that node will "morph" to match the input and output parameters of the function you wrote within the node itself. Sometimes it's simply faster to type a few lines of code instead of dealing with wire spaghetti!

###THIS IS WORK IN PROGRESS!

###'Binaries.zip' content must be unpacked to 'Plugins/MagicNodeSharp/Binaries/' if you expect this system to run.
